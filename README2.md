# Project Idea
link it is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between students in their final academic year, fresh graduates, and the professional world. Many students face challenges in transitioning from education to employment due to a lack of industry connections, unclear career pathways, or limited access to opportunities. CareerLaunch provides a streamlined platform where students can discover internships, entry-level jobs, and skill-building opportunities relevant to their field of study.
